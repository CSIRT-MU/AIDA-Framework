# AIDA Framework

A framework for the Analysis of Intrusion Detection Alerts.

## About AIDA Framework

AIDA is an analytical framework for processing intrusion detection alerts with a focus on alert correlation and predictive analytics. The framework contains components that filter, aggregate, and correlate the alerts, and predict future security events using the predictive rules distilled from historical records. The components are based on stream processing and use selected features of data mining (namely sequential rule mining) and complex event processing. The framework was designed to be deployed as an analytical component of an alert processing platform. Alternatively, it can be deployed locally for experimentations over datasets.
