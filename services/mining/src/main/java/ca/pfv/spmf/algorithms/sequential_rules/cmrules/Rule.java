 * as defined in association rule mining, plus the "sequentialTransactionCount" which is the support
 * as defined in sequential rule mining. Besides, each itemset (antecedent and consequent) carry their  
 * corresponding transaction ID lists (this is necessary for phase 2 of the CMRules algorithm).
