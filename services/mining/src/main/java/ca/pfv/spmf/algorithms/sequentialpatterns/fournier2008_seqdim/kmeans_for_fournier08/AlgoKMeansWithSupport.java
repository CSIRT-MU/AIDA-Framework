/**
 * This algorithm is a modified K-Means algorithm to be used with the Fournier-Viger-2008 algorithm, which.
 * adds the constraint of a minimum number of items per clusters (minimum support). 
 * <br/><br/> 
 * This implementation should only be used for the Fournier-Viger 2008 as it is specially designed
 * for it (e.g. it clusters valued items  and it keep the
 * min max and avg values of each clusters). For other purposes, one should use the general KMeans implementation
 * in the package "clustering". This latter implementation is more general (uses vector of doubles instead
 * of items) and is more optimized.
 * <br/><br/> 
 * This algorithm works as follows  <br/>
 * We  specify a maximum K.<br/>
 * The algorithmm executes K-Means from K=1 to K=Kmax and try to find
 * the largest number of clusters such that each cluster has a size that is larger
 * than the minimum support (as an integer).<br/>
 * The algorithm returns this set of clusters.<br/>
 * The algorithm stops at k=k+1 or when the number of clusters does not increase for
 * two successives K.
