/**
 * This is an implementation of the "faster algorithm" for generating association rules,
 * described in Agrawal &
 * al. 1994, IBM Research Report RJ9839, June 1994.
 * Here it is adapted for mining closed rules using the results obtained from the FPClose algorithm (the frequent
 * closed itemsets). 
 * The main difference with AlgoAgrawalFaster94.java, is that this implementation takes
 * a different type of Itemset object as input. Moreover, the method CALCULATESUPPORT() is 
 * different because if an itemset is not closed, we must find its closure to determine
 * its support. 
 * To implement the calculation of the support efficiently, this class uses the CFI-tree
 * generated by CFPClose. It allows to calculate very quickly the support of non closed 
 * frequent itemsets. This is the main difference with "AlgoClosedRules.java"
 * To avoid redundancy as much
 * as possible, this class is a subclass of AlgoAgrawalFaster94.java and share
 * several methods.
 * <br/><br/>
 * 
 * This implementation saves the result to a file
 * or can alternatively keep it into memory if no output 
 * path is provided by the user when the runAlgorithm()
 * method is called.
