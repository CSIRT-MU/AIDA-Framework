/**
 * This is an implementation of the main methods of SPAM algorithm. We keep open
 * the decision of which IdList to use. In the original paper, the authors use a
 * bitmap implementation. We have such implementation (IDListFatBitmap) but we 
 * also have other two ones (both based on hash maps, one with bitsets (IDListBitmap)
 * and another with arraylists (IDListStandard_Map)).
 *
 * NOTE: This implementation saves the pattern to a file as soon as they are
 * found or can keep the pattern into memory, depending on what the user choose.
