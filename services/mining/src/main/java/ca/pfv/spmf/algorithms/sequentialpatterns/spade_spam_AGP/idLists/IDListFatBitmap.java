/**
 * Inspired in SPMF. Implementation of a Idlist for SPADE and SPAM. This IdList
 * is based on a big bitmap and it codes all the sequences by means of a bitset
 * and a list of bitsets. In the first only set we keep the sequence identifiers
 * of all the sequences where the pattern appears. For each sequence we have an
 * itemset. Therefore, if we have a bitset with 512 bits, we also have a list of
 * 512 bitsets, where each bitset codes an itemset.
