/**
 * This is the definition of an equivalence class.
 * Each one is composed by a pattern that its the class identifier and the 
 * IdList associated with that pattern. Besides, it also contains all the
 * equivalence class children that are supersequences (by means i-extension 
 * or s-extension) of the class identifier.
 * In this way a complete structure of classes can be created from the root class
 * to the longest ones.
